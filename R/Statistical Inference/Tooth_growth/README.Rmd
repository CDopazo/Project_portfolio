## Introduction

The **"ToothGrowth"** data set contains the **length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs**. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C **(0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day)** by one of two delivery methods, **orange juice or ascorbic acid** (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).

The overall goal of this project is to **determine which supplement(Orange Juice or Vitamine C) is better for tooth growing** in the guineas pig.

## Exploratory analysis:

The data looks like this
```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
head(ToothGrowth)
```

Here is some overall information of the data set:
```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
source("coding/data_transformations.R")
str(ToothGrowth)
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

The dataset contains 60 observations of tooth growing for 60 Guinea Pigs subjects on 3 variables: 

**len:** length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth)

**supp:** supplement type/delivery method (orange juice:OC or ascorbic acid:VC)

**dose:** Vitamin C dose in millingrams (mg)

## Preliminary box-plot

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
source("coding/Plot_1.R")
```

[See the plot code here](XXXXXXXX)

In this preliminary chart it **seems like the Orange Juice (OJ) is a better supplement for Toothgrowing than Ascorbic Acid(VC)**, and also it seems like **a higher dosage leads to a higher growth of the tooth** regardless the type of supplement  but first we are going to do some  hipothesis testing to prove these statements.

## Hypothesis testing to find which is the better supplement:

A tests to compare tooth growth of the subjects by supplement (OJ, VC) and dose (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg) will be performed.

### The Hypotheses are:

**H0:** For a **given dose level** of Vitamin C, **there is no difference** in average tooth growth between the supplements ( OJ: Orange Juice or AA: Ascorbic Acid).

**Ha:** For a **given dose level** of Vitamin C, **there is a difference** in average tooth growth between the supplements ( OJ: Orange Juice or AA: Ascorbic Acid).

## Results of the supplement Hypothesis Testing:

#### Example of the overall **t.test output** for the supplements for the **0.5 dosage**:

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
H_0.5
```

* **For all dosage together**:

The null hypothesis H0 with alpha= 0.05 **CAN'T BE REJECTED**

The p-value of **`r H_all_dosage$p.value`** suggest there is insufficient evidence to show that there is a difference in tooth growth when using supplement Orange Juice and Ascorbic Acid at any dosage.

* **For the 0.5 mg dosage:**

The null hypothesis H0 with alpha= 0.05 is **REJECTED**

The p-value of **`r H_0.5$p.value`** suggest with a high probability that Orange Juice and Ascorbic Acid are not equally strong promoting the average tooth growth when the dosage is 0.5 mg.

* **For the 1.0 mg dosage:**

THE null hypothesis H0 with alpha= 0.05 is **REJECTED**

The p-value of **`r H_1.0$p.value`** suggest with a high probability that Orange Juice and Ascorbic Acid are not equally strong promoting the average tooth growth when the dosage is 0.5 mg.

* **For the 2.0 mg dosage:**

The null hypothesis H0 with alpha= 0.05 **CAN'T BE REJECTED**

The p-value of **`r H_2.0$p.value`** suggest there is insufficient evidence to show that there is a difference in tooth growth when using supplement Orange Juice and Ascorbic Acid at dosage 2.0 mg.

## Hypothesis testing to find if a higher dose leads to a highter tooth grow regardless the supplement.

### The Hypotheses are:

**H0:** For a **given supplement** of Vitamin C, **there is no difference** in average tooth growth between the dosage levels (0.5mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg of OJ: Orange Juice or AA: Ascorbic Acid).

**Ha:** For a **given supplement** of Vitamin C, **there is a difference** in average tooth growth between the dosage levels (0.5mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg of OJ: Orange Juice or AA: Ascorbic Acid).

## Results of the dosage Hypothesis Testing:

#### For all supplements:

* **Low dosage (0.5mg  vs 1.0mg) for all supplementes (OJ and VC):**

The null hypothesis H0 with alpha= 0.05 is **REJECTED**

The p-value of **`r H_low_mid$p.value`** suggest with a high probability that 0.5mg and 1.0mg dosage are not equally strong promoting the average tooth growth regardless the type of supplement.

* **High dosage (1.0mg  vs 2.0mg) for all supplementes (OJ and VC):**

The null hypothesis H0 with alpha= 0.05 is **REJECTED**

The p-value of **`r H_low_mid$p.value`** suggest with a high probability that 1.0mg and 2.0mg dosage are not equally strong promoting the average tooth growth regardless the type of supplement.

#### For the Orange Juice (OJ):

* **Low dosage (0.5mg  vs 1.0mg) for OJ:**

The null hypothesis H0 with alpha= 0.05 is **REJECTED**

The p-value of **`r H_OJ_low_mid$p.value`** suggest with a high probability that 0.5mg and 1.0mg dosage are not equally strong promoting the average tooth growth when the supplement is Oranje Juice.

* **High dosage (1.0mg vs 2.0mg) for OJ:**

The null hypothesis H0 with alpha= 0.05 is **REJECTED**

The p-value of **`r H_OJ_mid_high$p.value`** suggest with a high probability that 1.0mg and 2.0mg dosage are not equally strong promoting the average tooth growth when the supplement is Oranje Juice.

#### For the Ascorbic Acid (VC):

* **Low dosage (0.5mg  vs 1.0mg) for VC:**

The null hypothesis H0 with alpha= 0.05 is **REJECTED**

The p-value of **`r H_VC_low_mid$p.value`** suggest with a high probability that 0.5mg and 1.0mg dosage are not equally strong promoting the average tooth growth when the supplement is Ascorbic Acid.

* **High dosage (1.0mg vs 2.0mg) for VC:**

The null hypothesis H0 with alpha= 0.05 is **REJECTED**

The p-value of **`r H_VC_mid_high$p.value`** suggest with a high probability that 1.0mg and 2.0mg dosage are not equally strong promoting the average tooth growth when the supplement is Ascorbic Acid.

## Conclusions:

After executing all the hypothesis analysis, we can conclude that for this data of tooth growing in Guineas pigs that:

1. **At lower dosage (0.5mg and 1.0mg) the Orange Juice seems to be more effective than Vitamin C for tooth growing**. On the other hand **at a higher dosage (2.0 mg), there is a high probability that these supplements are equally effective for tooth growing.**

2. The **dosage seems to affect the growing of the tooth** in the Guineas pigs **regardless the type of supplements**.

All of these conclusions are assuming:

1. **Not paired observations:** because the data states that were 60 diferents guinea-pigs subjects

2. **Different variances:** The dataset provides no information on this subject, so the safer choice is to asume different variances.
