================

# Introduction

An analysis of the Olympics data from all the olympics games, **120
years of data including winter and summer seasons** was performed in
order to highlight patterns or trends linked mainly with the
**performance and health of the athletes and insights about the event
organization and participation.**

This presentation insighs are proposals for the **Olympics Review
magazine** which is the official magazine of the Olympic Movement.
Published quarterly in English, French and Spanish, its content is a mix

topics of interest to the sporting movement.

The data correspond to 120 years of olympics games, with **134.732
differents athletes** and **271.116 rows**.

Every row in the data correspond to record of some athlete playing in
some olympic event, the columns are athleteâ€™s: **Name, Sex, Age, Height,
Weight Team, NOC, Games, Year, Season, City, Sport, Event and Medal
Awarded**.

In this Readme you will find the questions answered with **Hypothesis
testing**.

But [here](https://github.com/CDopazo/Project_portfolio/blob/master/R/Regression%20Models/Olympics_Records/README.md) you can find some other questions answered with
**Regressions Models** about this same data set:

## Questions to answer with Hypothesis testing:

  - Athletes win more medals when games occur in their own country?.

  - Athletes that plays more than one sport (generalist) have a better
    performance than the ones that keeps with the same
    sport(specialists)?

# Hypothesis testing

### Hypothesis 1:

#### Own country athletes win more models than foreing athletes?

  - H0: Foreing atlhetes and Athletes from the same country hosting the
    games have the same probability to win a medal
  - H1: Foreing atlhetes and athletes from the same country hosting the
    games have a different probability to win a medal.

#### Chi-squared test summary 1:

    ## 
    ##  Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction
    ## 
    ## data:  table(medal_country$own_country, medal_country$medal)
    ## X-squared = 1353.6, df = 1, p-value < 2.2e-16

#### Conclusion 1:

**There is a significant statistical diference** (p-value: 2.2e-16)
between the medals awarded to athletes in their own countries and
athletes comepting in different countries, we can **reject the null
hypothesis**, same country atlethes have a probability of \~ 23% to win
any medal while different country athletes have \~ 14%. **A difference
around 9%.**

### Hypothesis 2:

#### Athletes that historically plays more than one sport (generalist) have a greater or lower probability to win a medal than the ones that keeps with the same sport(specialists)?

  - H0: Generalist and Specialist have the same probabilty of being
    awarded with any medal
  - H1: Generalist and Specialist have different probabilty of being
    awarded with any medal

#### Chi-squared test summary 2:

    ## 
    ##  Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction
    ## 
    ## data:  table(spegen_medal$medal, spegen_medal$group)
    ## X-squared = 9.1447, df = 1, p-value = 0.002494

#### Conclusion 2:

**There is a significant statistical diference** between the medals
awarded to specialist and generalists, generalist in average tend to win
more medals than specialists. **For every specialist are 0.14662
medals** and **for every generalist are 0.16307 medals**, maybe the
differences is little, but its statistically significant p-value:
0.0024944. **A difference less 2%.**
