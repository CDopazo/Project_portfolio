## Repository content:

### [Central Limit Theorem - Exponencial distribution](https://github.com/CDopazo/Project_portfolio/tree/master/R/Statistical%20Inference/Exponencial_distribution)

The over all goal here is show that at large numbers the distribution of
the collection of the **random exponentials samples** tend to a normal
distribution, **proving the Central limit theorem**.

### [Tooth Growth](https://github.com/CDopazo/Project_portfolio/tree/master/R/Statistical%20Inference/Tooth_growth)

The overall goal of this project is to **determine which
supplement(Orange Juice or Vitamine C) is better for tooth growing** in
the guineas pig.
