## Repository content:

### [Central Limit Theorem - Exponencial distribution](https://github.com/CDopazo/Project_portfolio/tree/master/R/Statistical%20Inference/Exponencial_distribution/README.md)

The overall goal here is show that at large numbers the distribution of
the collection of the **random exponentials samples** tend to a normal
distribution, **proving the Central limit theorem**.

### [Tooth Growth](https://github.com/CDopazo/Project_portfolio/tree/master/R/Statistical%20Inference/Tooth_growth/README.md)

The overall goal of this project is to **determine which
supplement(Orange Juice or Vitamine C) is better for tooth growing** in
the guineas pig.

### [Olympics Records](https://github.com/CDopazo/Project_portfolio/blob/master/R/Statistical%20Inference/Olympics_records/README.md)

An analysis of the Olympics data from all the olympics games, 120 years of data including winter and summer seasons was performed in order to highlight patterns or trends linked mainly with the performance and health of the athletes and insights about the event organization and participation.
