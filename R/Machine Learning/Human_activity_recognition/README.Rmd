## Introduction

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to **collect a large amount of data about personal activity ** relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the **quantified self movement** â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. 

```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,out.width="1000px"}
library(knitr)

```

One thing that people regularly do is **quantify how much of a particular activity they do**, but they **rarely quantify how well they do it**. In this project, **the overall goal is to use data from accelerometers** on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants, **to predict if they are doing the work properly or incorrectly**. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website [here]( http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

## Model Building

### Decision Tree modeling:

**Decision tree learning** is one of the **predictive modelling** approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. It uses a decision tree (as a predictive model) to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, **leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels**. (learn more about Decision trees here: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) )

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
summarytree
```

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,fig.height=10,fig.width=13}
source("coding/Plot_1.R")
```

[See the plot code here](XXXXX)

### Decision tree confusion matrix plot

In the field of machine learning and specifically the problem of statistical classification, **a confusion matrix**, also known as an error matrix, is a **specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm**, typically a supervised learning one (in unsupervised learning it is usually called a matching matrix). **Each row of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted class** while **each column represents the instances in an actual class**, or reference (learn more about confusion matrix here: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) ).

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,fig.height=5,fig.width=5}
source("coding/Plot_2.R")
```

[See the plot code here](XXXXX)

The accuracy for the **Decision Tree model is 0.7376**, its good but maybe we can find a model that fits better our data. We will try the Random Forest model.

## Random Forest modeling

**Random forests** or random decision forests are an ensemble learning **method for classification, regression and other tasks that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees** at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. **Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set** (learn more about Random Forest here: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) ).

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

```

### Random forest confusion matrix plot

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,fig.height=5,fig.width=5}
source("coding/Plot_3.R")
```

[See the plot code here](XXXXX)

The accuracy for the **Random Forest model is 0.9945** almost 100% of right guessing, 0,55% out of sample error**, we dont need to look for any other model, this one seems to be perfect.
