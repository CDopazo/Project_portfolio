US Weather events:
================

## Introduction

**Storms and other severe weather events** can cause both public health
and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe
events can result in **fatalities, injuries, and property damage**, and
**preventing** such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This analysis involves exploring the **U.S. National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database**. This database
tracks **characteristics** of **major storms and weather events** in the
United States, including **when and where** they occur, as well as
estimates of any **fatalities, injuries, and property damage**.

### Data:

The data for this assignment come in the form of a comma-separated-value
file: Download here:

There is also some documentation of the database available. Here you
will find how some of the variables are constructed/defined.

The events in the database **start in the year 1950 and end in November
2011**. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer
events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent
years should be considered more complete.

### Weather event Analysis:

The basic goal of this report is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and
answer some basic questions about severe weather events.

#### Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?
