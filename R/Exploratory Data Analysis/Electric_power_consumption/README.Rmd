## Introduction

An **exploratory data analisis** about some data from the **UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository** was performed, this is a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” was use, which is a data set of **measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years**. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the [UCI web site](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption):

1. **Date:** Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2. **Time:** time in format hh:mm:ss
3. **Global_active_power:** household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4. **Global_reactive_power:** household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5. **Voltage:** minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6. **Global_intensity:** household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7. **Sub_metering_1:** energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8. **Sub_metering_2:** energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9. **Sub_metering_3:** energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:

Our overall goal here is simply to **examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007** this will be performed with some ploting techniques.

### Household energy usage plots:
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
source("coding/data_subsetting.R")
```


#### Plot 1: Frequency of Global active power (killowatts)
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
source("coding/plot_1.R")
```

[See the plot code here](XXXXXX)

This is the frequency of the global active power of the house among all minutes in killowatts for the given days.

#### Plot 2: Global active power(killowats) VS time (days)
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
source("coding/plot_2.R")
```

[See the plot code here](XXXXXX)

This is a time serie for the given days of the household global minute-averaged active power in killowatts.

#### Plot 3: Energy sub metering VS time (days)
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
source("coding/plot_3.R")
```

[See the plot code here](XXXXXX)

This is a time serie for the given days of the three energy submeterings (kitchen,laundry room and electric water-heater/air conditioner).

#### Plot 4: Global reactive power (killowats) VS time(days)
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
source("coding/plot_4.R")
```

[See the plot code here](XXXXXX)

This is a time serie for the given days for the household global minute-averaged reactive power in kilowatts.

#### Plot 5: Merged Plots 1 to 4
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
source("coding/plot_5.R")
```

[See the plot code here](XXXXXX)

This is a plot that merges all the previous plots.
